          part of the Platform, particularly for technical and maintenance
          purposes. In addition, we shall use our best efforts to keep all
          relevant information on the Platform accurate and up to date but we
          cannot guarantee this at all times.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition, the internet and telecommunication networks are not
          error-free and interruptions and failures can occur. These
          interruptions and failures are outside MUNDOCRYPTO’s control. We
          cannot provide guarantees in this regard and shall not be held liable
          for any damage that may relate to the use of the internet and
          telecommunication networks, such as, for instance, damages derived
          from internet malfunctions or<strong> </strong>from a defective
          transmission and/or reception of any data and/or information via the
          internet or from defects of your equipment or the communications
          network equipment. Any charges for Internet access services are solely
          your responsibility.&nbsp;

          its best efforts to ensure the Platform is provided free of errors and
          viruses and to avoid incidents, and implements the security measures
          required by applicable legislation but MUNDOCRYPTO cannot offer
          further guarantees in this regard. To the extent permitted by
          applicable law, we exclude any and all damages caused, without
          limitation, by computer viruses or third-party hacks or intrusions or
          incidents.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          Nothing that is set forth in this document shall limit or exclude our
          liability for wilful misconduct, gross negligence or personal injuries
          or damages, nor any other liability that may not be limited or
          excluded by law. Without prejudice to the foregoing, our liability
          shall be limited to direct damage, excluding any other damage or loss
          whatsoever (including, without limitation, any indirect damage
          relating to any loss of profit, revenue or goodwill), to the extent
          permitted by applicable laws. This provision shall not be interpreted
          as a limitation or exclusion of liability in those cases where it is
          not permitted by law.&nbsp;

          10.1. Modification of the Terms of Use. MUNDOCRYPTO may amend the
          content of these Terms of Use from time to time for the purposes
          of:&nbsp;
        </p>

        <ol start="1">
          <li>
            adapting the Terms of Use to any regulatory or legislative
            provisions in force or in the process of being adopted;&nbsp;
          </li>
        </ol>

        <ol start="2">
          <li>
            adapting the Terms of Use to any decision of a judicial body, a
            consumer agency or body, or of any other competent authority, which
            affects the Platform or its content;&nbsp;
          </li>
        </ol>

        <ol start="3">
          <li>preventing abuses or damages or for security reasons;&nbsp;</li>
        </ol>

        <ol start="4">
          <li>
            making amendments to the wording of these Terms of Use (for
            instance, to correct grammatical or orthographic mistakes), to the
            extent that such amendments do not alter the content or meaning of
            these Terms of Use;&nbsp;
          </li>
        </ol>

        <ol start="5">

          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          MUNDOCRYPTO will provide prior notice of any amendment to these Terms
          before they become applicable via a general notice in the Platform,
          unless MUNDOCRYPTO is legally obliged to make the amendments
          immediately. If users do not accept the new conditions, they are free
          to stop using the Platform and/or delete your account. Otherwise, the

        <p>
          If, in any jurisdiction, any provision of these Terms of Use or their
          application to any party or circumstance is restricted, prohibited or
          unenforceable, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
          ineffective without invalidating the remaining provisions of these
          Terms of Use and without affecting the validity or enforceability of
          such provisions in any other jurisdiction or without affecting its
          application to other parties or circumstances. Where possible, any
          such provision shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law and
          be interpreted and applied to a lesser extent, where necessary to be
          valid.&nbsp;
