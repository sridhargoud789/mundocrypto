        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>70-hour course: 4 months.&nbsp;</li>

          IF COURSES AND TESTS ARE NOT COMPLETED WITHIN THESE PERIODS OF TIME

        </p>

        <p>
          At the end of each unit, Students will have to pass a test. You agree
          to respect all the applicable rules in order to pass the test, as
          described on the Platform.&nbsp; Please be aware that test rules could
          include, but are not limited to, observing what you do during the test

          tests have been passed successfully, the Course will be considered
          completed. The Course will remain available in “My Learning” section
          for a definite period of time after completion. This period will be
          indicated in each Course description and the length will depend on
          each specific Course.&nbsp;

          among its different units and corresponding tests so Students will
          earn the reward progressively as they successfully pass each test of
          the Course. The Student will get the full rewards for the Course if
          they pass all the tests and meet the conditions listed
          below.&nbsp;&nbsp;

          ORDER TO EARN REWARDS, STUDENTS WILL NEED TO CONNECT THEIR WALLET
          following the steps in Section 3.1 above. If you have purchased a
          Course without connecting a wallet, please make sure to connect one
          before you claim any rewards or otherwise the Platform will not allow
          you to successfully claim rewards. If the wallet is properly
          connected, you will be able to claim the reward and it will be
          released instantly.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          The total rewards offered for each Course will be duly indicated in
          the Platform and/or Course description.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          The rewards will be distributed in $MCT. The value of the rewards will
          be based on the value of the Course (in United States Dollars (USD))
          at the time of purchase, regardless of when the reward is being
          distributed. For instance, and merely for clarity purposes, in a 1:1
          parity scenario between USD and $MCT, where the price of a Course is
          500 USD and the related rewards amounts to 20%, the Student will
          receive a total of 100 $MCT upon Course completion (i.e., after having
          passed all the tests successfully), regardless of the $MCT price at
          the time of releasing the reward.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          Regarding each Course, MUNDOCRYPTO may set forth additional, different
          or more specific requirements to pass the exams of the Course and/or
          to obtain the offered rewards. Students shall carefully read any
          additional terms which may be available on the Platform and/or the
          Course description.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>5. Right of withdrawal</strong>&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          You shall have a period of fourteen (14) calendar days to withdraw
          from the contract, without giving any reason, and without incurring
          any costs. This withdrawal period will expire after fourteen (14)
          calendar days from the day of the conclusion of the contract.
        </p>

        <p>
          If a Course has been pre-ordered, you may withdraw from the contract
          within fourteen (14) calendar days of purchasing the Course.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you start the course, you will lose the right to withdraw and any
          corresponding refund.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before the expiry of the withdrawal period, you shall inform us of
          your decision to withdraw from the contract.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          To exercise your right of withdrawal, you must inform us (Mundo Meta
          Limited, Palm Street, P.O. BOX 828, Victoria, Mahe – Seychelles,
          info@mundocrypto.com) of your decision to withdraw from the contract
          before the end of the withdrawal period by an unequivocal statement
          (e.g. a letter sent by post or by e-mail). You may use this “Model
          Withdrawal Form”, but it is not obligatory. This withdrawal form is
          also available here.&nbsp;

        </p>

        <p>
          If you withdraw from the contract, we shall reimburse all payments
          received from you without undue delay and in any event not later than
          fourteen (14) calendar days of the day we were notified of your
          decision to withdraw from the contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          We shall carry out the reimbursement using the same means of payment
          as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly
          agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a
          result of such reimbursement.&nbsp;

          withdrawal period, (i) the Course has been completed, or (ii) the
          Course has initiated with your prior express consent and your
          acknowledgment that you thereby lose your right of withdrawal.&nbsp;

          All refunds or reimbursements shall be made in the same method as the
          one used by the Student to make the payment and will total the same
          amounts as those paid by the Student.&nbsp;

        <p>
          Students shall bear direct costs incurred by MUNDOCRYPTO (up to a 5%

          effective.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>

          10.2. Severability. If, in any jurisdiction, any provision of these
          Terms or their application to any party or circumstance is restricted,
          prohibited or unenforceable, such provision shall, as to such
          jurisdiction, be ineffective without invalidating the remaining
          provisions of these Terms and without affecting the validity or
          enforceability of such provisions in any other jurisdiction or without
          affecting its application to other parties or circumstances. Where
          possible, any such provision shall apply to the fullest extent

          where necessary to be valid.&nbsp;
