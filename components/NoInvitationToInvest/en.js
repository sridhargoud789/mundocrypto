          Investment in cryptoassets is not regulated, may not be suitable for
          retail investors and the entire amount invested may be lost. It is
          important to read and understand the risks of this investment which
          are explained in detail below.
          <br />
          <br />
          High-risk investment product:
          <br />
          The value of investments and the return on investments may experience
          significant upward and downward fluctuations and the entire amount
          invested may be lost.
        </p>

        <p>
          <br />
          Investments in early stage projects involve a high level of risk, so
          it is necessary to properly understand their business model.
          <br />
          Cryptoassets within the scope of Circular 1/2022, dated January 10, of
          the National Securities Market Commission, regarding advertising of
          cryptoassets presented as investment objects, are not covered by
          customer protection mechanisms such as the Deposit Guarantee Fund or
          the Investor Guarantee Fund.
          <br />
          <br />
          The prices of cryptoassets are constituted in the absence of
          mechanisms that ensure their correct formation, such as those present
          in regulated securities markets.
          <br />
          Many cryptoassets may lack the necessary liquidity to be able to
          unwind an investment without suffering significant losses, since their
          circulation among both retail and professional investors may be very
          limited.
          <br />
          <br />
          Risks inherent to the technology:
          <br />
          Distributed registry technologies are still at an early stage of
          maturity, with many of these networks having been created recently, so
          they may not be sufficiently tested and there may be significant flaws
          in their operation and security.
        </p>

        <p>
          <br />
          The recording of transactions in networks based on distributed log
          technologies works through consensus protocols that can be susceptible
          to attacks that attempt to modify this record and, if these attacks
          are successful, there would be no alternative record to back up these
          transactions and therefore the balances corresponding to the public
          keys, and all the cryptoassets could be lost.
          <br />
          The anonymity facilities that cryptoassets can provide make them a
          target for cybercriminals, since in the case of stealing credentials
          or private keys they can transfer the cryptoassets to addresses that
          make their recovery difficult or impossible.
          <br />
          Cryptoassets can be held in custody by the holders themselves through
          their digital wallets or by a third party provider of these custody
          services. The custody of cryptoassets is a very important
          responsibility since they can be lost in their entirety in the event
          of theft or loss of the private keys.
          <br />
          <br />
          Legal risks:
          <br />
          <strong>
            The acceptance of cryptoassets as a medium of exchange is still very
            limited and there is no legal obligation to accept them
          </strong>
          .<br />
          <em>
            In general, service providers have their registered office outside
            the EU, and therefore, the resolution of any conflict could be
            costly and outside the scope of competence of the Spanish
            authorities. Mundo Meta Limited, a company dedicated to the
            development of information and education activities in the field of
            blockchain technology and cryptoassets, provides its services from
            Seychelles, and therefore, the resolution of any dispute could be
            costly and outside the scope of competence of the Spanish
            authorities.

        <p>
          The investor may not have access to the crypto-assets when they are in
          digital wallets (“wallets”) of a custody service provider and not have
          access to the private keys for the control of the crypto-assets. In
          such case, you must have a password that allows you to access your
          account to carry out the corresponding transaction, subject to
          confirmation from the service provider. In the case of $MCTs, when the
          investor does not hold the cryptoassets because they are in digital
          wallets (“wallets”) of a third party service provider it is important
          that he/she reads, understands and verifies the terms and conditions
          of the custody offered by such third party service provider before
          acquiring his/her $MCTs in order to know the extent of his/her rights
          as a user in relation to the custody of his/her cryptoassets.
        </p>

        <p>
          The custody of cryptoassets involves a very relevant responsibility as
          they may be lost in their entirety in the event of theft or loss of
          the private keys. In the case of $MCT (utility token that allows
          access to the Crypto World ecosystem to benefit from the products and
          services provided within it),&nbsp;users acquiring the token may
          decide to grant custody to a third party service provider (e.g. Bybit
          as a custody service provider when acquiring $MCT through its trading
          platform), in which case the assets are held in the wallets of this
          third party service provider, or decide to have their $MCT held in
          custody through their own wallets, in which case the users themselves
          have control over the custody of their $MCT. In the event that your
          $MCTs are held in custody by third party cryptoasset custody service
          providers, it is important that you read, understand and verify the
          terms and conditions of the custody offered by such third party
          service provider before acquiring your $MCTs in order to know the
          identity of the entity performing the custody of $MCTs, the country in
          which it performs the custody and the applicable legal framework.
