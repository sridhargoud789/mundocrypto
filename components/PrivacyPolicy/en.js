          <strong>Registration</strong>&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          Registration allows users, including business users, to access
          services and functionalities available on the Platform, such as
          enrolling in online courses or leave comments.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          Only users over the age of 18 can register, unless so permitted by the
          holder of the parental responsibility.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>MUNDOCRYPTO offers you different ways to register:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            You can register by creating an account, for which we will request
            the information necessary for the login and contact
            information.&nbsp;
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>
            You can register via designated social media accounts. In this case,
            MUNDOCRYPTO will access your social media username to authenticate
            you and, where permitted by you, access and process information
            about your social media account. &nbsp;
          </li>

          <li>
            You can connect your wallet as a way of registration. Wallets allow

            storing their passwords or keys. If you connect your wallet you will
            share with us your public address and will allow us to visualize
            your funds. We will never ask you to provide us access to your funds
            or to allow us to carry out any action regarding your funds other
            than visualization.&nbsp;
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          MUNDOCRYPTO uses this information to the extent necessary to provide

          newsletter by providing your email in the corresponding section of the
          Platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;

          In case a business user purchases courses for other individual users,

          its employees, individual users will need to register normally but

          crypto address from which the payment is received, the funds available
          in your wallet). We may need this information to manage refunds in

          will use the data necessary to process your reward (your wallet’s
          public address).&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>

            3. For how long do we collect and use your information?
          </strong>
          &nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          Our commitment is to use your information for no longer than what is
          necessary to achieve the purposes explained.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          When we use your information to provide you with the services and
          functionalities available on the Platform, we use your information for
          the time necessary to provide you with these services and
          functionalities. Where the information you provide is not strictly
          necessary to provide the service or functionality, it means that you
          are free to include this information (for instance, information to
          build your profile) or that we have obtained it with your previous
          consent (for instance, information obtained from cookies), and,
          therefore, you can choose whether and to what extent you want us to
          stop using this information. Please refer to section 2 to understand
          how to avoid our using of your information for this
          purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          If we see that your account and/or profile is inactive for a long
          period of time (after three years with no activity), we might contact
          you to see whether you want to keep your account and/or profile or
          whether it is better to delete it.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          When we use your information to inform you about content that might be
          relevant for you, you can decide when we shall stop using it. Please
          refer to section 2 to understand how to avoid our using of your
          information for this purpose.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          When we use your information to operate the Platform, we stop using it
          and delete it once we have completed the activity for which we are
          using the information. For instance, we will keep the information you
          provided us in relation to an error in the Platform until that error
          is fixed or before, if we think the information is no longer necessary
          to fix the error. When we use information to prevent or fight against
          fraudulent or harmful activity, we will keep the information for as
          long necessary to arrive at conclusions and delete it in case we find
          there is no wrongdoing. Where we find there has been a wrongdoing, we
          will keep the information for the time necessary to exercise or
          defense against legal claims.&nbsp;

        <p>
          Oftentimes, we are required by law to retain your personal information
          for a period of time before it can be permanently deleted from our
          systems. In these cases, we will make sure your information remains
          duly blocked, so it is only accessible to privileged personnel and
          public authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p>
          MUNDOCRYPTO may modify this Privacy Policy for several reasons. For
          instance, this could happen if we needed to reflect any legal or
          regulatory changes, or to adapt to decisions by public authorities.
          Also, if we needed to reflect changes to the way we handle personal
          data or changes to the services and functionalities available on the

          this Privacy Policy without altering its content or meaning.&nbsp;

          When these modifications significantly change the way we use your
