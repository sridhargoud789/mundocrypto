        When you visit a website, a cookie is a little text file that the
        website saves on your computer or mobile device. This short text file
        may contain a unique identification that allows your computer or mobile
        device to be distinguished from other devices. In this Policy, we use
        the term “cookies” to refer to website cookies as well as similar
        technologies that may collect information automatically when you visit

          for the duration of the browser session and are automatically removed
          when you close your browser. “Persistent cookies” cookies live after
          your browser is closed until a predetermined expiration date provided
          in the cookie (as determined by the party that placed it) and aid in

          <strong>First Party and Third-Party Cookies:&nbsp;</strong>First-party
          cookies are those that are placed on a website by the site’s owner, in
          this case, MundoCrypto. Third-party cookies are set on a website by
          third-party providers (such as organizations that provide advertising
          monitoring or web analytics services) as well as by website
          advertisers. As explained below, we use both first-party and
          third-party cookies.

          <strong>Pixel Tags:&nbsp;</strong>We also utilize pixel tags (often in
          conjunction with cookies) from the third parties listed below to
          collect information about your use of the Websites and interactions
          with email or other communications. Pixel tags are a cookie-like
          technology that can be included in online content or inside the body
          of an email to track activity on websites (for example, to know when
          content has been shown to you) or to know when you have viewed
          specific content or an email message.

        Our cookies are either first-party or third-party cookies. The website
        or domain that places the Cookie determines whether the Cookie is
        ‘first’ or ‘third’ party. In the context of this Cookies Policy, first
        party Cookies are those set by us, and all information gathered from
        such Cookies is received by us, whereas third party Cookies are those
        set by third parties with whom we do business. When you visit the
        Websites, these parties may install unique Cookies on your browser to
        gather information about your use of the Websites and perhaps other
        online activities over time and across multiple websites and apps. These
        third parties acquire data directly from your web browser and process it
        in accordance with their respective privacy policies.&nbsp;Depending on
        their lifespan, first or third-party Cookies are classified as
        ‘persistent’ or ‘session’ Cookies:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Persistent cookies</strong>&nbsp;are retained on your device
          between browser sessions and allow us to remember your preferences or
          actions across the websites (or, in some situations, across many
          websites). Persistent Cookies can be used for a variety of objectives,
          such as remembering your preferences and selections when using the
          Websites or targeting advertising. These Cookies do not expire when
          your browsing session ends and remain on your device until an
          expiration date defined by the Cookie’s provider, unless you disable
          this.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Session Cookies:</strong>&nbsp;We can relate your actions
          throughout a single browser session thanks to session cookies. A
          session begins when you open a browser window and ends when you exit
          the browser window, at which point all session cookies are destroyed.
          These Cookies may be used for a variety of purposes, including
          remembering what you clicked on, on the previous page you visited.

        We may also use cookies or other e-mail tracking technologies to track
        the success of our e-mail campaigns (for example, recording how many
        e-mails in a campaign were opened, the IP address, browser, or email
        client types which the emails were read). If you do not want us to track
        emails we send to you, certain email services allow you to adjust your
        display settings to turn off HTML or disable image downloads, which
        should essentially disable our email tracking. You can also unsubscribe
        from our marketing mailings by following the instructions provided in

        Some web browsers support the transmission of “Do Not Track” signals.
        MundoCrypto does not presently process or respond to “Do Not Track”
        signals since consistent standards for “Do Not Track” signals have not

        In addition to “Do Not Track,” web browser signals and similar

        and we may not be aware of or honor all of them.
